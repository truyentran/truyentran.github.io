<p align="left"><font size="+2">The <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/a2i2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute</span></a> (A<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>), co-led by
Professor <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/%7Esvetha">Svetha Venkatesh,</a> is an AI-focused research body,
currently undertaking research in the following areas:</font></p>
<p><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="+2">AI Fundamentals</font></p>
<font size="+2">We study all relevant aspects of intelligence and
build systems that learn to read from text, perceive the world, build world model,
remember the past, imagine the future, reason, collaborate with others
and act on the world. &nbsp;See <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2016/12/machine-learning-in-three-lines.html">this
blogpost</a> for our view on machine learning, and <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2016/12/machine-learning-four-years-after.html">its recent developments</a>. Major sub-areas:</font><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="+2"><br>
</font>
<ul><li><font size="+2"><i><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grand unified cognitive architecture</span></i><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
in what we aim to build a single principled computational architecture
that can replicate and explain human cognitive capabilities across
scales in time.</font></li><li><font size="+2"><i><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deep
learning and beyond</span> </i>in
that we find&nbsp;efficient ways for end-to-end
learning
with minimal human supervision. It achieves the goals through
abstractions, iterative estimation and differentiable programming. Our
sub-areas include, but not
limited to, generative models, graphs, relational models, memory and
attention, continual learning, one model for all,
learning to reason, learning from instructions and construction of and
inference on knowledge
bases. See <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2017/01/one-expressiveness-learnability-and.html">this
blogpost</a> on why deep learning works, <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2016/12/tutorial-on-deep-learning-and.html">this post</a> for a tutorial, and <a href="https://truyentran.github.io/repLearn.html">this page</a> for works done so far by us.</font></li><li><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Bayesian optimization</span>
in that we learn to quickly find high-quality solutions through
qualified
uncertainty. The method works best when the objective function is
expensive, such as those in product developments and long-term
simulations.</font></li><li><font size="+2"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Reinforcement learning</i>
in that an agent acts on the world,&nbsp;interacts with others, builds
theory of mind, imagines the future and receives feedbacks. Equipped
with deep nets for perception, memory, statistical relational learning,
and reasoning capabilities, we aim to
bring RL to a new level.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></font></li><li><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Build the world model from observations</span>.
Learning from large labelled data as we do today does not scale, and it
is not anywhere near human intelligence. A better way is learning
to represent the world just by perceiving the world, reading from text
or watching videos with little hints from teachers.&nbsp;Intuitive
physics, knowledge graphs and the like will naturally emerge, just like
those discovered by infants.<br></font></li></ul>
<p align="left"><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="+2">AI Applications</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">We
want to use AI to make the world better. Here are a few things we are
passionate about:</font></p>
<ul>
              <li><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Computer vision</span> in
which we want to understand and reason about videos, talk about movies, read children stories, monitor
streets, detect baby unusual movements. See <a href="https://icetana.com/">iCetana</a> for our product in action to make a safer world.</font></li><li><font size="+2"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Natural language processing</span>
in which we build agents to read text, answer multi-turn questions,
hold a long conversation, share human values and talk about health. We
also leverage NLP techniques for<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">scientific extraction from text and ideas emergence</span>
in which we learn to read the scientific texts, extract machine
computable knowledge, model the emergence and dynamics of ideas over
time, and support scientific reasoning and question answering. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>
                </span></font></li>
              <li><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Molecular and materials sciences </span></font><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>in
which we use AI to replace hard&nbsp;physical computation and
experiments such as computing quantum chemical properties, predicting
molecular properties &amp; interactions, predicting chemical reactions,
understanding the structure and characteristics of materials, searching
for new alloys, and generating molecules &amp; crystals. Part of these is accelerating  <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">new product development</span>
by finding best configurations for producing new products. See  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515927/">our recent work</a> on a faster way to make new materials, and <a href="https://truyentran.github.io/science.html">other works here</a>.</font></li>
              <li><font size="+2"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Drug design</span>
in which we aim to model the entire drug-like space, compute
bioactivity, predict binding to proteins, and best of all, generate new
drugs with a given set of desirable properties.<br>
                </font></li><li><font size="+2"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Genomics </i></font><font size="+2">in
which we aim to unlock the one of the most mysteries of nature -
our genomes, map genotype-phenotype, answer any genomic queries for a
given sequence (DNA, MtDNA, RNA, etc), predict drug-protein
interactions, and learn to generate DNA.<br>
                </font></li>
              <li><font size="+2"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Healthcare</i> in which we aim to (a)&nbsp;understand about patient's health, need,
preference and intention
through patient's diverse sources of data (medical records, -omics,
user-generated media, medical imaging and biosignals);
(b)&nbsp;acquire&nbsp;and reason about established medical knowledge;
(c) have a
meaningful dialog with patients; (d) recommend the personalized course
of medical actions; (e) support doctors and hospital managers to
improve their precision and efficiency. See <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2017/02/living-in-future-deep-learning-for.html">this
blogpost</a> for some futuristic ideas and <a href="https://truyentran.github.io/healthcare.html">this page for works done</a> by us so far. See <a href="http://ihosp.com/">iHosp</a> for our current startup for more effective hospital services delivery, and <a href="http://tobyplaypad.com/">Toby PlayPad</a> for supporting learning in autistic children.</font></li>
              <li><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Smart homes</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
in which we model human activities and sensing systems/IoT within a
home
to assist/empower the tenants in their everyday life. An important AI
goal is to build a situated conversational agent that can hold
meaningful conversations with tenants. A high impact environment will
be aged care homes.</font></li>
              <li><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Automated software engineering</span>
in what we want to read the code, fix the bugs, synthesize programs, translate between
languages,&nbsp;automate
the programming process, understand developer and support team
management. See <a href="https://truyentran.github.io/transparentML.html#Software_analytics">this page</a> for the latest update on our research. </font></li>
<li><font size="+2"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other cool apps</span>: </span>(A)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Cybersecurity through anomaly
detection</span> in that we detect unusual behaviors
without supervision. We aim to handle the complexity of data types, networks, relations and dynamics. (B)&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Recommender systems</span>
in that we deliver personalized content to user. See <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/markov-random-fields-for-recommender.html">this post series</a> for some of our works.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br></font>
</li></ul>
<p align="left"><font size="+2"><b><a name="Selection_criteria">Selection
criteria</a></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">There
is no single selection criterion and we can only say that we look for
candidates who have <i>good potential</i> to have a
successful <strong>research career</strong>,
not just a PhD degree.
If you do not know what it takes for a research career, I recommend
that you should spend time to read about it. See, for example, <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2016/12/making-dent-in-machine-learning-or-how.html">this blogpost</a> for a view on how AI research these days is going. Sometimes it will help you
decide whether you need a PhD or not.&nbsp;Here is the list of things we are looking for</font></p>
<ul><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Thirst
of knowledge and willing
to pursue a research career. PhD is just a stepping stone, and a
by-product of the learning process.</font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Research
experience (e.g. has published papers). </font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Academic
recognition: university prizes and awards. High quality honours at high
school (such as&nbsp;members of&nbsp;national or international
teams) may also count.&nbsp;</font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Bachelor/Master
in CS/Maths/Physics with excellent
academic performance from a well-recognised university. For those with
Australian qualifications, the standard requirement is an Honours
degree.&nbsp;</font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Good
math background (we will use a lot of&nbsp;statistics, optimization and linear algebra).</font></p></li><li><font size="+2">Good machine learning &amp; <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">AI background</a>. As a general rule of thumb, a good AI/ML PhD student will be likely to have covered <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/%7Ehastie/ElemStatLearn/">statistical machine learning</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models">probabilistic graphical models</a>. A prior exposure to <a href="https://truyentran.github.io/deep.html">deep learning</a> is a great bonus.<br></font></li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Good
programming skills. An ability to scale up to large datasets is a bonus. </font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Good
English (generally IELTS score 6.5,&nbsp;no bands below 6, is
required for entry, but
you should be aware that this score is insufficient for smooth
communication). Good critical reading skills are vital
because you will spend up to 50% of your time for reading. Technical
writing is also important because it is often the end-product for
assessment, and it accounts for 50% chance of acceptance. </font></p>
</li></ul>
<p align="left"><font size="+2"><b><a name="What_to_send">What to send</a></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">The
rule of thumb is that you should send whatever (electronic) documents
you think that will support your future research career. Before you
send these, I recommend that you spend time to study research areas and
publications by </font><font size="+2">A<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup></font><font size="+2">. Documents are written in English and may include
some of the following:</font></p>
<ul><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">A
comprehensive resume (or CV); </font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Academic
transcripts; </font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Theses;
</font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Published
papers or technical reports (if written in languages other than
English, titles and abstracts should be translated to English); </font></p>
</li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">A
statement of purpose briefly describes your research intention and
interests, general approach to reach your PhD/career goals;</font></p></li><li><font size="+2">Proposal for the intended thesis; and<br></font></li><li>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Reference letters from your professors. </font></p>
