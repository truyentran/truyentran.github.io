<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">The
<a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/src/prada">Centre
for Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics</a> (PRaDA), led by
Professor </font><a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/%7Esvetha"><font face="Tahoma">Svetha Venkatesh,</font></a><font face="Tahoma"> is a multidisciplinary research body,
currently undertaking research in the following areas:</font></p>
<font style="font-weight: bold;" face="Tahoma">Machine learning</font><br><ul><li><font face="Tahoma"><i>Deep
learning: </i>a
key to machine learning is to effectively and
efefciently represent raw complex data in a manner that offers higher
level of inderstanding and makes the data processing tasks easier. The
goal of representation learning is to automatically extract useful
representations of data. Deep learning offers a layer-by-layer way to
achieve that goal. This is not only efficient but also offers
wider coverage than the traditional manual feature engineering. This
enables <span style="font-weight: bold;">end-to-end learning</span> with minimal human supervision.</font></li><li><font face="Tahoma"><i>Nonparametric
Bayesian methods: </i>addressing the limits of current parametric models
by letting the complexity of the models grow with data and
automatically determine the model size that fits the data.</font></li><li><font face="Tahoma"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lean data</span>:
current machine learning is data hungry. There are many areas that do
not have much data, for example, experiments in manufacturing. The goal
is to learn useful things that are data efficient.</font></li></ul><p align="left"><font style="font-weight: bold;" face="Tahoma">Applications</font></p><ul><li><font face="Tahoma"><i>Healthcare analytics:&nbsp;</i>modern health information systems have collected a
huge amount of data which is mostly sitting there unused. By using
advanced machine learning techniques, we aim at discovering useful
clinical patterns, associations and causal rules as well as acurately
predicting the outcomes a head of time. PRaDA has made huge progress in this area.</font></li><li><font face="Tahoma"><i>Pervasive/wearable/ubiquitous
computing: </i>leveraging our expertise in sensing, pattern
recognitions and data modelling, we aim at developing technologies that
can help improve lifestyle, work and health, assist decisions&nbsp;and
and provide personalized medicines. See <a href="http://tobyplaypad.com/">TOBY PlayPad</a> for a
product for autistic children.</font></li><li><font face="Tahoma"><i>Social
media</i>: continuing its strength in multimedia,&nbsp;PRaDA
now extends its reach to social media, including blogs, social
networks, personal/social media management. Due to its multimedia
nature, research will deal with text, hyperlinks, image, audio, video
and streaming data. Applications in sentiment analysis, mental health surveillance and public health measurement and tracking.</font></li><li><font face="Tahoma"><span style="font-style: italic;">Other mahine learning application areas</span>: recommender systems, manufacturing, software engineering, NLP &amp; vision. <br></font></li></ul>
<p align="left"><b><a name="Selection_criteria"><font face="Tahoma">Selection
criteria</font></a></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">There
is no single selection criterion and we can only say that we look for
candidates who have <i>good potential</i> to complete a
PhD program and to have a successful <strong>research career</strong>, not just a PhD degree.
If you do not know what it takes for a research career, I recommend
that you should spend time to read about it. Sometimes it will help you
decide whether you need a PhD or not.&nbsp;</font><font face="Tahoma">Here is the list of things we are looking for</font></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Thirst
of knowledge and </font><font face="Tahoma">willing
to pursue a research career</font></p></li><li><p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Research
experience (e.g. has published papers) </font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Academic
recognition: university prizes and awards. High quality honours at high
school (such as&nbsp;members of&nbsp;national or international
teams) may also count.&nbsp;</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Bachelor/Master
in Computer Science/Informatics/Information Technology with excellent
academic performance from a well-recognised university. For those with
Australian degrees, the standard requirement is an Honours
degree.&nbsp;</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Good
math background (we will use a lot of math for data modelling, likely
probability/statistics and linear algebra) </font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Good
programming skills </font></p>
</li>


<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Good
English (generally IELTS score 6.5 (with no bands below 6) or better is required for entry, but
you should be aware that this score is not generally enough for smooth
communication. Good reading skills with critical thinking are vital
because you will spend up to 50% of your time for reading. Technical
writing is also important because it is often the end-product for
assessment.) </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b><a name="What_to_send"><font face="Tahoma">What to send</font></a></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">The
rule of thumb is that you should send whatever (electronic) documents
you think that will support your future research career. Before you
send these, I recommend that you spend time to study research areas and
publications by PRaDA. Documents are written in English and may include
some of the following</font></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">A
comprehensive resume (or CV) </font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Academic
transcripts </font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Theses
</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Published
papers or technical reports (if written in languages other than
English, titles and abstracts should be translated to English) </font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">A
statement of purpose briefly describes your research intention and
interest, general approach to reach your PhD/career goals </font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Any
supporting documents, like reference letters from your professors </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">You
can send your documents directly to&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a href="mailto:santu.rana@deakin.edu.au">Dr Santu Rana</a>.</span></p>
