            <p><big>&gt;&nbsp;</big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Agents as Digital Species</span>
presents the concept that an agent has lifewide experience to interact
and work with other agents and humans, evolving lifelong with the
dynamics of its environments. Equipped with perception, memory,
statistical relational learning, theory of mind, common sense,
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, we aim to bring this new digital
species to a new level.</big></p><p><big>We will invent new kinds of
machine learning, explore novel forms of computation and learning to
improve lifelong adaptation with small energy footprints. This
includes, but is not limited to, small-but-powerful language/foundation
models, learning to explore, human-in-the-loop, self-supervised
learning, knowledge-guided learning, prompt optimisation, distillation,
continual learning, novelty seeking, intrinsic motivation, and
physics-informed ML.</big></p><p><big>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">System 2 Capability</span>
focuses on finding efficient ways for learning to reason with minimal
human supervision and solving complex problems that require deliberate
thinking. Our sub-areas include, but are not limited to: causal
inference, systematic generalisation, graph neural networks, relational
models, memory and attention, reasoning, and knowledge-guided learning
to reason.&nbsp;</big><big></big></p>
            
            
            <p><big>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">AI Alignment</span>
focuses on developing novel machine learning frameworks to incorporate
human perspectives, sometimes implicit, into AI to mitigate negative
impacts caused by unintended consequences if left unchecked. Expected
outcomes include new frameworks for machines to rapidly learn from and
reason about human preferences, and actively pursue benefits for humans
as intended. Expected benefits are advanced capabilities for effective
human-machine partnership, pushing the frontier of responsible AI.<br>

which we use AI to automate the expensive discovery loop, and bring
science into AI models. Examples include replacing hard&nbsp;physical
computation and
experiments such as computing quantum chemical properties, predicting
molecular properties &amp; interactions, predicting chemical reactions,
understanding the structure and characteristics of materials, searching
for new alloys, and generating molecules &amp; crystals. See  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="AI4Science/index.html">recent works here</a>. Important areas include energy storage and carbon capturing, </big><big>The broader picture includes green energy, climate
change and sustainability.</big><br><big>
            <br>
            </big><big>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Health</span> in which we aim to
(a)&nbsp;understand about patient's health, need,
preference and intention
through patient's diverse sources of data (medical records, -omics,
user-generated media, medical imaging and biosignals);
(b)&nbsp;acquire&nbsp;and reason about established medical knowledge;
(c) have a
meaningful dialog with patients; (d) recommend the personalized course
of medical actions; (e) support doctors and hospital managers to
improve their precision and efficiency. See <a href="https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com.au/2017/02/living-in-future-deep-learning-for.html">this
blogpost</a> for some futuristic ideas and <a href="AI4Health/index.html">this page for
works done</a> by us so far. </big><big>The agenda also includes <span style="font-weight: bold;">d</span></big><big><font style="font-weight: bold;">rug discovery</font>
in which we aim to model the entire drug-like space, compute
bioactivity, assess adverse effects, predict binding to targets, and best of all, generate new
drugs with a given set of desirable properties. See for <a href="https://truyentran.github.io/ecmlpkdd2021-tute.html">our tutorial</a> at ECML 2021.</big><br>

criteria</a></b></font></p>
            <big> </big>
            <p align="left"><big>There
is no single selection criterion and we can only say that we look for
candidates who have potential to have a
successful <strong>research career</strong>,
not just a PhD degree.
If you do not know what it takes for a research career, I recommend
that you should spend time to read about it. Sometimes it will help you
decide whether you need a PhD or not.&nbsp;Here is the list of things
we are looking for:</big></p>
            <big> </big>
            
            <ul>
              <li><big>Thirst
of conquering the unknowns and willing
to pursue a research career. PhD is just a stepping stone, and a
by-product of the learning process.</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Research
experience (e.g. has published papers).</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Academic
recognition: university prizes and awards. High quality honours at high
school (such as&nbsp;members of&nbsp;national or international
teams) may also count.&nbsp;</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Bachelor/Master
in CS/Maths/Physics with excellent
academic performance from a well-recognised university. For those with
Australian qualifications, the standard requirement is an Honours
degree.&nbsp;</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Good
math background (we will use a lot of&nbsp;statistics, optimization and
linear algebra).</big></li>
              <li><big><i><font style="font-weight: bold;">
                </font></i>Good
programming skills. An ability to scale up to large datasets is a bonus.</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Good
machine learning &amp; <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">AI
background</a>. As a general rule of thumb, a good AI/ML PhD student
will be likely to have covered <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/%7Ehastie/ElemStatLearn/">statistical
machine learning</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models">probabilistic
graphical models</a>. A prior exposure to deep learning is a
great bonus.</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Good
English (generally IELTS score 6.5,&nbsp;no bands below 6, is
required for entry, but
you should be aware that this score is insufficient for smooth
communication). Good critical reading skills are vital
because you will spend up to 50% of your time for reading. Technical
writing is also important because it is often the end-product for
assessment, and it accounts for 50% chance of acceptance.</big></li>

            <big> </big>
            <p align="left"><big>The
rule of thumb is that you should send whatever (electronic) documents
you think that will support your future research career. Documents are written in
English and may include
some of the following:</big></p>

transcripts;</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Theses;</big></li>
              <li><big>
            Published
papers or technical reports (if written in languages other than
English, titles and abstracts should be translated to English);</big></li>
              <li><big>

statement of purpose briefly describes your research intention and
interests, general approach to reach your PhD/career goals;</big></li>
